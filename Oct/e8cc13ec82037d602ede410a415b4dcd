The United Kingdom and the European Union changed entry rules for Argentines this week, with new details regarding vaccination. The European Union announced that, “following the improvement of the epidemiological situation in Argentina,” those who have not been vaccinated or inoculated with the Sputnik V shot will now be able to enter the bloc, provided they have a negative test result and perform a quarantine. From London, the UK government announced that more than 30 countries and territories, including Argentina, would be added to the list of countries with vaccination certificates that are recognised for entry. Given the vaccines recognised by UK authorities, this effectively means that individuals in Argentina who have completed programmes of the Oxford-AstraZeneca (including its various forms such as Covishield), Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Janssen shots can enter the UK without the need for quarantine. The decision comes just days before the COP26 climate summit begins in Glasgow, Scotland, which will see delegates from across the world.  – TIMES/BLOOMBERG/NA
