President Alberto Fernández will seek support of world leaders at the G20 leaders' summit in Rome for a new agreement with the International Monetary Fund, the Peronist leader's spokesperson Gabriela Cerruti confirmed at a press conference at the Casa Rosada. Cerruti said the government is "united" on how to approach an agreement with the IMF and that the Peronist leader would seek the backing of key figures during bilateral and general meetings. Argentina is currently negotiating the restructuring of a US$45-billion loan from a failed 2018 programme agreed under former president Mauricio Macri's government. For his part, President Fernández will meet with the Fund's managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, at a bilateral meeting on Saturday. The president will also hold talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Spanish President Pedro Sánchez and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Cerruti, who said Argentina is still working to expand Fernández's bilateral meeting agenda, did not comment on whether the government requested a meeting with US President Joe Biden. – TIMES/BLOOMBERG [Reporting by Jorgelina do Rosario]
