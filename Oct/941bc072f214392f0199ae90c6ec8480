Argentina's National Securities Commission (CNV), the country's securities regulator, has called for public consultation to create a framework for foreign issuers to list securities on Argentina's local markets, according to an emailed statement from the regulator. The new regime would simplify regulatory requirements for companies to list in local markets. The dual listing of foreign companies aims to "promote quality foreign direct investment in the country, boost the export engine and strengthen the competitiveness of the capital market." The CNV and the Mining Secretariat of the National Productive Development Ministry signed a framework collaboration agreement to offer incentives to companies seeking to list in the country, according to the statement.   by Scott Squires, Bloomberg
