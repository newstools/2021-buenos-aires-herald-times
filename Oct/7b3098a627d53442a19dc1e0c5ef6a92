The UK government on Thursday announced a dramatic reduction to its coronavirus travel "red list", scrapping bans on foreigners travelling to England from 47 countries, including Argentina. Under the new rules that come into effect from 0300 GMT on Monday October 11, only seven countries – Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Haiti, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela – will remain under the restrictions. Removal from the "red list" means passengers will no longer be required to enter hotel quarantine. Instead, those required to enter lockdown can spend their 10-day period at a home or private residences. However,  certificates issued by Argentina's government regarding Covid-19 vaccination are not currently recognised by the UK’s scheme, meaning most will need to follow the same rules as an unvaccinated individual. This effectively means that travellers must take a test three days before their trip to England, while undertaking subsequent tests upon their arrival in the UK on their second and eighth day in the country while undertaking a 10-day quarantine. Those wishing to leave isolation early can book a private test on day five through the Test to Release scheme. All arrivals must also complete a form identifying their place of residence during their spell in the UK within 48 hours of arrival.
