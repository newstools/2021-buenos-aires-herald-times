Legendary Argentine actress and TV host Mirtha Legrand, 94, was recovering from a heart operation on Thursday, according to the Buenos Aires hospital where she was admitted. The beloved "diva," who has hosted lunch and dinner interviews on the small screen for years, underwent "studies in the cardiology service and a coronary obstruction was found, which was resolved with the placement of two stents," said the Sanatorio Mater Dei clinic in a statement. "She is recovering in a coronary unit room for better care. She is in excellent spirits accompanied by her family," it concluded. Legrand was a popular film star and actress across Latin America in the 1940s and 1950s, starring in nearly 40 films and performing in dozens of plays. Her popularity reached its peak when she became a sharp and ironic interviewer of politicians, artists and assorted stars hosting her televised gastronomic gatherings.  – TIMES/AFP
