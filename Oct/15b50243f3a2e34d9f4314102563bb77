Queen Elizabeth II will not attend a reception next week at the United Nations climate change summit hosted by the United Kingdom, and will send a video message instead. “Following advice to rest, The Queen has been undertaking light duties at Windsor Castle,” the monarch’s office said. “Her Majesty has regretfully decided that she will no longer travel to Glasgow to attend” the COP26 reception on November 1. The announcement comes after the 95-year-old head of state stayed in hospital last week on the advice of doctors, a visit that was kept secret and confirmed by the palace only when it was revealed by The Sun newspaper. The Queen was seen using a walking stick for the first time during a Westminster Abbey service on October 12.
