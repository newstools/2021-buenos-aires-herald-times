The Buenos Aires British Cemetery (Cementerio Británico de Buenos Aires) hosted a Remembrance Day event this November 11, attended by representatives from several entities from the British community. At 10.45am, proceedings got underway with a ceremony at the Memorial Wall, which bears the names of nearly 900 volunteers from Argentina who lost their lives in World War I and World War II. Poppy wreaths were laid by John Hunter, president of the British Cemetery; Charlie Fox, chairman of the Argentine British Community Council (ABCC); Santiago Pezzati, president of the Argentine British Chamber of Commerce; Francis Fernie, former chairman of the British Hospital and Tim Lough from the British Legion ex BA Branch. At 11am, the traditional two minutes of silence were observed. Those present then accompanied the piper to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission sector of the cemetery, where another wreath was presented in memory of the fallen who rest there. The Annual Remembrance Day Service, which should take place on Sunday, November 14, has been postponed until Sunday, November 21, due to the legislative elections. This year's service will take place at St. John the Baptist Anglican Cathedral.
