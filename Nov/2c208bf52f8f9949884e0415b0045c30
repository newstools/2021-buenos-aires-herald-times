Argentina, one of the world’s most prominent defaulters, is pushing for a new way to service debt: instead of paying creditors with cash that’s in short supply in Buenos Aires, it wants them to recognise the country’s efforts to tackle climate change. “We need more flexibility to honour that debt,” President Alberto Fernández said, at a United Nations climate summit, of about US$46 billion that Argentina owes to the International Monetary Fund. “We’re willing to link part of the payment to essential investments in green infrastructure.” COP26 Climate talks in Glasgow include a discussion on how rich countries can help poorer ones like Argentina to make the expensive transition to cleaner energy. by Jonathan Gilbert, Bloomberg
