Argentina’s government on Friday announced new rules, including the implementation of a health pass to attend activities in closed spaces, amid growing concerns over a new coronavirus variant identified in South Africa and Botswana. Health Minister Carla Vizzotti announced at a press conference that the planned resumption of direct flights to African countries had been postponed until mid-December. Those arriving from the continent will also have to undergo Covid-19 testing and undertake a 14-day period of isolation. "The pandemic did not end, let's not underestimate the risks," warned Vizzotti, indicating that information is needed "on the lethality [of the new variant] and coverage of vaccines." Vizzotti considered that Argentina is "in a favourable epidemiological situation with a low and stable number of cases, despite huge population mobility thanks to the advance in vaccination." Around 65 percent ​​of Argentina’s 45-million population has been vaccinated with two doses. Discussing the health pass requirement, Vizzotti explained that it will be granted to those who have received both doses of vaccine. "We need to complete the vaccination schedules and advance strongly with the reinforcements, always with the care measures, the use of face masks in closed spaces and in places with massive crowds of people," he explained. Argentina reported 1,912 new cases of Covid on Friday and another 25 deaths. Since the pandemic began, 5,324,039 infections and 116,505 deaths from coronavirus have been registered. – TIMES/AFP
