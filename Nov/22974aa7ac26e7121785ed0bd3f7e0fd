Chile’s conservative presidential candidate José Antonio Kast expanded his team of economic advisers, including one from a centre-right rival he beat in Sunday’s election, as he seeks to broaden his business credentials ahead of the run-off next month. Key policy goals such as lowering taxes will be done “in accordance with reality,” Kast said in a press conference. Foreign investors must go back to seeing Chile as a responsible country with a promising future, he said on Thursday. Here are Kast’s main advisers:  Kast topped the first round of presidential elections on Sunday, and will face off against former student protest leader Gabriel Boric in a highly polarised run-off on December 19. A trained lawyer and former lawmaker, Kast backs lower taxes, a smaller government and free enterprise. By contrast, Boric pledges higher levies, better public services and more equality. On Thursday, Kast also said he is considering economic proposals from government coalition parties and that his program is “not set in stone.” Both Kast and Boric are rushing to secure endorsements while also adding on to their teams. This week, Boric included former central bank President Roberto Zahler and professor Andrea Repetto among his economic advisers.
