Workers in the oil industry in Argentina will receive wage increases next month, according to a government statement released after an agreement between industry groups and unions in the sector. Oil workers will receive an advance payment on their 2022 wage increase, which will mean a 15 percent increase in their December 2021 wages. In May, both parties agreed to a 35 percent increase in the November 2021 salary, to be paid in three installments. by Alvaro Ledgard, Bloomberg
