Former Boca Juniors and Argentina midfielder Fernando Gago resigned as coach of top-flight side Aldosivi on Monday, becoming the league's ninth trainer to leave their post since the start of the season. According to local press reports, Gago, 35, decided to step down as coach of the Mar del Plata-based side after their heavy 3-1 home defeat to Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata – the Tiburon's sixth straight loss in the Copa de la Liga Profesional. This latest departure renews doubts over the stability of coaches in local football. Prior to Gago's decision to step down Juan Antonio Pizzi (Racing), Sergio Rondina (Arsenal), Miguel Russo (Boca), Gustavo Coleoni (Central Córdoba), Mariano Messera and Leandro Martini (Gymnastics LP), Sebastián Méndez (Godoy Cruz), Juan Azconzábal ( Unión) and Leonardo Madelón (Platense) had all left their posts with just 13 rounds of fixtures completed. After retiring as a player in November 2020 – after an injury-ridden career taking in spells at Boca Juniors, Real Madrid and AS Roma among others – Gago re-emerged as Aldovisi's coach in January this year. In nine months in charge, he oversaw 26 games, with a record of seven wins, three draws and 16 losses. Aldosivi's start to the season was promising, with three wins in the first five games, but as after the eighth round of fixtures, the side slumped into a string of defeats, conceding 17 goals in the last six games alone. Aldosivi are currently 23rd in the league, with just three teams below them, but they run the risk of relegation given their performance in the previous two seasons. – TIMES/AFP
