Argentina reported 33,902 Covid cases Tuesday, the highest since a daily all-time high reached June 18, amid a budding third wave of the pandemic. The country also reported 20 deaths, a pace that’s remained steady and below three digits since September, according to data from the public health department. Cases in Argentina have been rising steadily since mid-December, while case counts globally hit a daily record Monday amid the spread of the highly-transmissible omicron variant. Argentina has fully vaccinated 78 percent of its population – one of the highest inoculation rates in Latin America – and is now encouraging citizens to take a booster shot, with 10.2 percent already having received it, according to the Bloomberg vaccine tracker. The country has eased most restrictions and allowed foreign tourists back into the country since November 1. President Alberto Fernández told local media earlier Tuesday that he’s not currently looking to implement additional restrictions – instead, announcing price measures to make local tourism more accessible. Health Minister Carla Vizzotti is expected to meet with provincial health authorities to assess the country’s situation. by Carolina Millan, Bloomberg
