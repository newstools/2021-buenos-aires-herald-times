A main crude oil pipeline carrying oil produced in Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale formation was partially shut for repairs after a spill on Friday, according to a spokeswoman for Oleoductos del Valle (Oldelval), the line's operator. The leak was detected between the Crucero Catriel and Medanito pumping stations, an area that produces Medanito oil. The causes of the incident are under investigation while clean-up work is ongoing. The line was closed for transport between the Medanito pumping station to the north of Puesto Hernández, where it connects to another line supplying YPF's Luján Cuyo refinery. Transport is normal on the rest of the line, including deliveries to Puerto Rosales for export and distribution to domestic refineries. There is no schedule yet for the restart of the closed segment. The 1,700-kilometre Oldelval pipeline transports crude oil from Vaca Muerta to Puerto Rosales in Buenos Aires Province.  by Lucia Kassai, Bloomberg
