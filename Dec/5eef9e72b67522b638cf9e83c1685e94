Argentina's liberal lawmakers will not support an agreement between the International Monetary Fund and the country because they expect it will only force the private sector to make adjustments, Javier Milei, national deputy for the Libertad Avanza party, said in an interview. An agreement with the IMF, currently under negotiation, will have to be approved by Congress in order to be valid. Currently, Libertad Avanza has four legislators in the lower house, out of a total of 257. Milei says he expects the IMF to be forced to reach an agreement with the government because Argentina's debt represents 30 percent of the institution's debt and 50 percent of its disbursements. Still, statements by some Argentine officials raising fears of default worsen the market's perception of the country. Libertad Avanza is in contact with some members of the main opposition coalition Juntos por el Cambio and is open to collaborating on bills that promote tax cuts. The long-term goal of Milei's party is to break the status quo in Argentine politics and have candidates running on the La Libertad Avanza ticket in all provinces by 2023. According to Milei, Argentina will explode into a crisis sooner or later, given that the government saw an exceptional inflow of dollars in 2021, but this will not continue in 2022. by Ignacio Olivera Doll, Bloomberg
