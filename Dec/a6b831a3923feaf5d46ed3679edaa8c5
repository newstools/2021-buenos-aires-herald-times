Argentina reported 42,032 Covid cases Wednesday, a record high, as Omicron continues to spread across the country. Cases in Argentina have been rising steadily since mid-December as the circulation of the Omicron variant increases, said Health Minister Carla Vizzotti earlier Wednesday at a press conference, at a time when case counts globally are near records. South America’s second-largest economy also reported 26 deaths, a pace that’s remained steady and below three digits since September, according to public health data. Argentina has fully vaccinated 80 percent of its population – one of the highest inoculation rates in Latin America – and is now encouraging citizens to take a booster shot, with 11.2 percent already having received it, according to the Bloomberg vaccine tracker. The country has eased most restrictions and allowed foreign tourists back into the country since November 1. “Thanks to our high amount of vaccinated people, we’re seeing an exponential increase in cases, but that hasn’t led to higher mortality or emergency hospitalisations,” Vizzotti said. “We were able to delay the arrival of the Delta variant so much that we managed to avoid a wave – and now, we’re going through the third wave.” Intensive care units in Argentina are at an occupancy rate of 35 percent, the health portfolio added. by Carolina Millan, Bloomberg
