President Alberto Fernández was vaccinated with a third dose of the Sputnik V shot against Covid-19 on Monday, almost nine months after his last jab. Sharing a photograph of the moment on social media, the Peronist leader called on citizens to follow suit in order to "sustain this epidemiological situation." "It is important that we all complete our vaccinations and give ourselves boosters to sustain this epidemiological situation and continue to grow [economically]. Don't hesitate, get vaccinated," said the head of state in a post on Twitter. Infections and deaths have dropped significantly from the peak of the pandemic back in April, though they have risen slightly over the last two week. Authorities on Monday confirmed 2,477 confirmed cases and 34 deaths in the preceding 24 hours. Fernández, 62, was given the booster shot at his office at the Casa Rosada at around 7.30pm. The inoculation was confirmed by the Presidential Medical Unit, which issued a statement announcing the news signed by its director Federico Saavedra. The president received his first dose of Sputnik V on January 21 at the Hospital Nacional Profesor Alejandro Posadas and the second on February 11. Health authorities have recommended Covid-19 vaccination for all individuals in Argentina over the age of three. Adults over the age of 50 have already begun to receive a third booster dose. Argentina, with 45 million inhabitants, has registered 5.34 million cases and 116,646 deaths from Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic. According to Health Ministry data 67.57 percent of the population has already received two doses, while another 20 percent have received a first dose but have not been fully vaccinated.  – TIMES/AFP/NA
