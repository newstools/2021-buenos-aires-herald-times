Argentina's 1978 World Cup winner Ubaldo Matildo Fillol said late on Monday he is in hospital after contracting coronavirus. Former goalkeeper Fillol, 71, played 56 games for his country and won the league title with River Plate seven times. He also played for Argentinos Juniors, Flamengo in Brazil, Atlético Madrid and Racing Club. 'El Pato' tested positive for the virus last week and had been isolating in his home in San Miguel del Monte, 100 kilometres south of Buenos Aires. "For those who ask about my state of health, I tell you that this afternoon I am being admitted to clinic in the capital to be a little more controlled," he posted on Twitter. "It was not going well and as a precaution this decision was made. Thank you all for the concern and the good vibes. Take care," added Fillol, widely considered to be one of Argentina's greatest goalkeepers.  – AFP
