Sport & Tourism Minister Matías Lammens says fans will be able to return to football stadiums in "late September or early October." The Cabinet official said that the Health Ministry has been talking to clubs about when supporters will be able to attend matches and that an agreement is “very close.” He said that initially, sporting venues would be limited to 30 percent capacity. "In the coming days, we are going to define a schedule for the return of the public to stadiums. We are very close [to an agreement] and are working with the Ministry of Health to confirm it shortly. It would be for the end of September or the beginning of October," said Lammens, who has long ties to the San Lorenzo football club. "In previous talks they spoke of 30 percent capacity," he confirmed. As anticipated, the minister said that away fans – who are banned from attending matches as a result of violence and hooliganism – would still be banned from attending matches. “This has been the case and it is a decision that today is not a priority to take," said Lammens. The last fixtures played before spectators in Argentina was in mid-March 2020, when Copa de Superliga matches took place. Speaking Wednesday in a separate interview, Lammens told journalist Eduardo Feinmann that all mass events, including entertainment and cultural events, would come back with Covid-19 protocols, with attendances raised "little by little."  – TIMES/NA/PERFIL
