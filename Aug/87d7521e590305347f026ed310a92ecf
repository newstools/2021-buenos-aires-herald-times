The Casa Rosada will confirm that First Lady Fabiola Yañez is pregnant this weekend, according to sources inside the Presidency. Multiple news outlets on Friday said an announcement is pending. Social networks erupted with rumours last week after Yañez, 40, posted images on Instagram of her suggestively holding her belly while President Alberto Fernández delivered a speech on tourism in Misiones Province. Sources told the Noticias Argentinas news agency that the announcement “will surely be made with a post” on the first lady’s Instagram account. "The news will be made official over the weekend," said one insider, adding that the idea is “to wait until the weekend to release the news.” The news has reportedly come as something of a surprise to many inside the Casa Rosada, while President Fernández, 62, is yet to pass public comment. The revelation comes hot on the heels of the so-called ‘Olivos-gate’ scandal, which has seen the presidential couple come under fire after it emerged they held a clandestine birthday party at the Olivos presidential residence last year, during the height of the coronavirus lockdown. Fernández has a son from his first marriage, Estanislao Fernández, a design student and a well-known drag queen who goes by the stage name Dyhzy. The president reportedly met Yañez while she was doing research for her university dissertation, which focused on “tensions between Néstor Kirchner and Clarín from 2003 to 2007."  – TIMES
